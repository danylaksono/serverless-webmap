# Serverless WebMap Prototype

A prototype of a serverless web map app based on PMTiles, using Maplibre GL JS and Cloudflare Workers.
Heavily inspired by this [Simon Willisonâ€™s TILs](https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/gis/pmtiles.md).

## Components

- **PMTiles**: A specification for serving raster tiles from a key-value store.
- **Maplibre GL JS**: A JavaScript library for interactive, customizable vector maps.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless platform for deploying and running code at the edge of the network.
